# DOM Improvement Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on improving the Document Object Model (DOM). Each project explores different aspects of the DOM and provides solutions, enhancements, or utilities to streamline DOM manipulation and interaction.

## Project List

- **Project 1:** [Task_1](https://github.com/AliIbrahimov/DOM_Tasks/tree/master/Task_1) - The Background Color Changer is a simple project that allows you to change the background color of a webpage by clicking a button. It demonstrates a basic DOM manipulation technique using JavaScript.
- **Project 2:** [Task_2](https://github.com/AliIbrahimov/DOM_Tasks/tree/master/Task_2) - The Data Attribute Element Manipulation project is an example implementation that demonstrates how to manipulate HTML elements based on their data attributes using JavaScript. It targets elements with the class name "box" and applies different styles and content based on their data-id attribute value.


## Why DOM Improvement?

The DOM is a powerful API that allows web developers to interact with the structure and content of web pages. However, working with the DOM can sometimes be cumbersome and inefficient, especially when dealing with complex manipulations or performance-sensitive operations.

The projects in this repository aim to address common pain points of working with the DOM and provide solutions to improve efficiency, readability, and maintainability of code that involves DOM manipulation.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
